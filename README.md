# Tarallo

## Requirements
To run all the components of the Tarallo framework, you will need the necessary Python packages specified in the "venv_requirements" folder. We highly recommend creating a separate virtual environment for each module of the Tarallo framework.

Please be aware that certain requirements are associated with the white and black box models used in our experiments. These requirements may have slight dependencies on the hardware used during the experiments, as they rely on implementations in Keras and PyTorch.

## Usage
In each module, you will find a "master.py" file. Simply run this file and utilize the command line interface to choose your desired option. However, please ensure that you have set the necessary paths in the configuration files of each module before running them. This step is crucial for proper execution.
